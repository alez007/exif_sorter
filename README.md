# Exif Sorter

### Description
I needed a small script to read exif information from my google drive images and sort them accordingly in a structure
like `YYYY/MM/DD`. If exif information doesn't exist, it'll try to read the date from file name.

### Usage
exif_sorter.py --source-dir <source_dir> --dest-dir <dest_dir>
